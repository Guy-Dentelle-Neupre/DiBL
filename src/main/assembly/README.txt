3x3_1 and 4x4_522 were used too bootstrap the templates.

Execute with a command line, for example:

	java -jar dibl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar tcptc < input/3x3_1.txt > 3x3_1_tcptc.svg

Standard input:
	text version of a traversal pattern
Standard output:
	SVG file (if there is just one argument)
Arguments:
	one or more stitch types. Currently available: tcptc tcp

In case of multiple arguments: numbered SVG files are created in the current directory.
Beware of a large numbers:
3x3 with 3 different stitches generates 3^(3x3) = 19683 files, 
4x4 with 2 different stitches generates 2^(4x4) = 65536 files.
