Execute with a command line, for example:

	java -jar dibl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar tcptc < input/3x3_1.txt > 3x3_1_tcptc.svg

Standard input:
	text version of a traversal pattern
Standard output:
	SVG file (if there is just one argument)
Arguments:
	one or more stitch types. Currently available: tcptc tcp

In case of multiple arguments: numbered SVG files are created in the current directory.
Beware of a large number of files: Stitches ^ (rows x columns)
So 2 stitches and a 4x4 input file generates 2^16 = 65536 files
