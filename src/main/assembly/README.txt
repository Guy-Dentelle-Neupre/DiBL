3x3_1 and 4x4_522 were used too bootstrap the templates.

A command line has the following structure:
java -jar <jar-file> <input-file> <output-folder> <stitch>...

Examples:
java -jar dibl-0.1.jar 3x3_1.txt folder1 tcptc tc tc 
java -jar dibl-0.1.jar 3x3_1_1.svg folder2 tc tcptc

The first command example generates mirrored and rotated 
thread diagrams from a pair traversal diagram 
repeating the specified stitches.
The second example uses output of the first with
permutations of the stitches over the tile positions.
Beware of large numbers in the second example:
a 3x3 SVG with 3 different stitches generates 3^(3x3) = 19683 files,
a 4x4 SVG with 2 different stitches generates 2^(4x4) = 65536 files.
Hints to edit the produced SVG files are provided  on
